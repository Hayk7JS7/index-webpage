            <div class="p-animation-2"><p>Vartan and his work were so popular that people from distant villages and regions would attend St. Hakob church to personally communicate with Vartan and acquire the essential oils he made. Initially, Vartan was presenting the oils to the church, the believersâ€™ community, his friends and acquaintances. Afterward, in the late 1740s, Samvel, the son of Vardan, an ambitious young man, persuaded his father to increase the volume of the essential oils he produced and sell them on the market. Simultaneously, Samvel acquired flowers and plants from caravans coming from the west and the east, which allowed to expand the range of the products.</p></div>
